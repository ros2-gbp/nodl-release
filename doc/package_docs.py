"""Build-time staging of per-package ``doc/`` trees into the combined site.

Each shipped package authors its own ``<pkg>/doc/`` tree that is standalone-buildable by ``rosdoc2`` for docs.ros.org.
The combined Read the Docs site reuses those same sources by copying each tree under ``_generated/packages/<pkg>/``
(gitignored, like the schema mirror) so a single Sphinx project can list them in its toctree.

This is the same move ``schema_reference.mirror_schemas_for_docs`` makes: stage generated/external content beneath the
docs source dir so one build sees everything, without committing copies or symlinks.
