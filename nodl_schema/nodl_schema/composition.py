"""Resolution and merging of NoDL documents referenced by the ``include`` key.

A reference is a URI whose scheme selects a resolver.
Resolvers are registered, so which schemes work is a runtime property rather than a fixed list,
and the most recently registered resolver that handles a reference is the one used.

A resolver returns document text, not a path, since a reference need not name anything on a filesystem.
