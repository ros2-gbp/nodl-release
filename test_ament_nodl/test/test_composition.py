"""End-to-end composition test: resolve a nodl:// include through the real ament index.

These check that the reference form lines up with what registration installs, which a fake
resolver cannot show. The documents registered here are declared in CMakeLists.txt.

Including documents are authored in the tests rather than registered.
A nodl:// reference reads the installed workspace, so a document cannot reference its own
package at build time, before that package is installed.
